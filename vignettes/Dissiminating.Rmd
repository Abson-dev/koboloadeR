At the end of the data interpretation process, comes the time for data dissemination. 

Two distinct processes are involved:

- Sharing of anonymised microdata under specific licence (Public Use File for highly anonimised/important information loss data and/or Scientific Use File for moderately anonymised / moderate information loss  data). The standard platform for this is NADA microdata library.

- Sharing of weighted and agregated crosstabulation in open data platform. The standard for this are [CKAN servers]()
